# OWASP_IOTgoat_build_for_A5-V11_mini_3G_router


This repo has been made in regard to an issue with the OWASP IOTgoat project

https://github.com/OWASP/IoTGoat

The IoTGoat Project is a deliberately insecure firmware based on OpenWrt and maintained by OWASP as a platform to educate software developers and security professionals with testing commonly found vulnerabilities in IoT devices.

The IOTgoat project offer some pre-made binaries for Raspberry Pi 2 and X86 machines. Additionally, a VMDK image to use with VMware/VBox and virtualization with Qemu.

However, Internet Of Things (IOT) devices are non-standard computing "hardware". 
IOT devices in essence are gadgets that connect wirelessly to a network and can transmit data. IOT most times are small and inexpensive. 

Enter the A5-V11 mini router
